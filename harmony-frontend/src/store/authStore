/**
 * authStore.js
 * Purpose: Lightweight global state for authentication-related data.
 * Why: Provides a simple shared reactive store without using a full state
 *      management library (e.g., Pinia/Vuex), which would be overkill here.
 * Scope: Used to track login status and basic user session state.

// Vue reactive() is used to create a shared, reactive state object
import { reactive } from 'vue'

// Global authentication store shared across views and components
export const authStore = reactive({
  
  isLoggedIn: false,// Indicates whether the user has successfully logged in

  phone: '',   // Stores the phone number used during login

  profileUnlocked: false    // Controls access to profile-related views after verification

})
// Note: This store is intentionally minimal and can be extended if needed.
